** In an attempt to learn github and how to collaborate, I created a second GH account and
forked this project from my main account (delphee).  I will make some changes and create a
pull request, so I can see how all of this looks and works from  both ends.

Users can enter the lottery with ETH based on a USD fee
An admin will choose when the lottery is over
The lottery will select a random winner

How do we want to test this?

1. 'mainnet-fork'
2. 'development' with mocks
3. 'testnet'
